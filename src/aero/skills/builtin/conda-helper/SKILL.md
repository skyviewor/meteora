# Managed Runtime Helper

## Runtime Ownership

`uv` installs the Aero CLI. `aero setup` and `ensure_runtime_tools` manage a
separate scientific runtime:

- Micromamba: `~/.aero/runtime/bin/micromamba`
- Environment: `~/.aero/runtime/envs/aero-agent`
- Python: `~/.aero/runtime/envs/aero-agent/bin/python`

The user's Conda, Mamba, Miniconda, Anaconda, base environment, and named
environments are outside Aero's control.

## Required Flow

1. When a supported command such as `ncks`, `cdo`, or `grib_ls` is missing,
   call `ensure_runtime_tools` with the command names.
2. Ask for installation consent through that tool's confirmation.
3. Let the tool download Aero's managed Micromamba if necessary, recreate the
   fixed `aero-agent` prefix, install mapped conda-forge packages, and verify
   that binaries resolve inside the managed environment.
4. Retry the original operation after success.

Do not manually create environments, install Mamba, activate an environment,
or create PATH symlinks. Aero prepends its private `bin` directory when
executing commands.

## Pip-only Packages

Install pip-only Python packages with the managed interpreter:

```bash
~/.aero/runtime/envs/aero-agent/bin/python -m pip install -U <package>
```

`cnmaps` is always pip-only:

```bash
~/.aero/runtime/envs/aero-agent/bin/python -m pip install -U cnmaps
```

Never put `cnmaps` or `cnmaps-data` in a conda/mamba transaction.

## Hard Rules

1. Install on demand, never pre-install without need.
2. Never run `conda create`, `conda install`, or `conda activate`.
3. Never use a user-provided `mamba` or `micromamba`.
4. Never reference `~/miniconda3`, `~/anaconda3`, or a base environment.
5. A missing managed environment is rebuilt by `ensure_runtime_tools`; it is
   not a reason to fall back to user software.
6. Use one fixed `aero-agent` runtime for all managed tools.
