# Weather Verification with cyeva

`cyeva` is the required metric engine for deterministic meteorological forecast
verification. This is not a recommendation: a verification result calculated only with
NumPy, pandas, xarray, or handwritten formulas is incomplete and must not be delivered.
Treat alignment and quality control as part of the result, not as optional preprocessing.

## Mandatory execution gate

Before calculating or reporting any verification score:

1. Read [`references/cyeva-api.md`](references/cyeva-api.md).
2. Import `cyeva`, record its version, and select the appropriate comparison class.
3. Instantiate that class with the aligned observation/forecast pairs and call its metric
   methods.
4. Keep an execution trace that shows both the `cyeva` import and the actual comparison
   class/method calls. Merely installing or importing the package does not satisfy this
   requirement.

If `cyeva` cannot be imported, install it in Aero's managed interpreter before computing
metrics. Do not first produce a provisional NumPy result. If `cyeva` still cannot execute,
report the dependency blocker and stop instead of silently substituting another
implementation.

## Required workflow

1. Establish the verification definition before calculating:
   - variable and units;
   - observation and forecast sources;
   - valid time, lead time, station/grid identity, and aggregation period;
   - spatial/temporal pooling or stratification;
   - for precipitation, accumulation duration and category/threshold.
   Ask a short clarification only when an unresolved choice would materially change the
   result.
2. Inspect both datasets and align them by valid time plus station or grid location. Never
   flatten two independently ordered arrays and compare them by position.
3. Harmonize units, coordinates, calendars, time zones, accumulation windows, and spatial
   resolution. Regridding or interpolation must be disclosed.
4. Build one paired validity mask over observation and forecast. Remove NaN and infinity
   together, then report original count, matched count, rejected count, and coverage.
5. Select the cyeva comparison class and a small, justified metric set:
   - general continuous fields: `Comparison`, normally RMSE, MAE, and MBE;
   - temperature: `TemperatureComparison`, including within-1°C/within-2°C accuracy when
     useful;
   - precipitation: `PrecipitationComparison`, using the correct accumulation duration and
     exact category or cumulative threshold;
   - wind: `WindComparison`, evaluating speed and circular direction separately.
6. Stratify by lead time and, when relevant, station, region, season, or intensity. State
   whether a reported aggregate is pooled over all pairs or averaged across groups.
7. After cyeva has produced the primary result, independently spot-check at least one
   continuous metric or contingency-table count with NumPy. This check must never replace
   the cyeva result. Investigate NaN or zero-division results instead of silently replacing
   them.
8. Deliver a compact table, sample/QC summary, metric interpretation, and limitations. Do
   not label a single score as overall “accuracy.”

Before writing evaluation code, read
[`references/cyeva-api.md`](references/cyeva-api.md) for exact methods, precipitation
levels, metric directions, and known limitations.

## Runtime and plotting

- First test `import cyeva` and record `cyeva.__version__` when available. Preserve the
  version used in reproducible output.
- If it is missing, follow `conda-helper`: install it only into Aero's managed interpreter
  with `~/.aero/runtime/envs/aero-agent/bin/python -m pip install -U cyeva`. Never modify
  the user's Conda base environment.
- If the request includes a figure, also use `scientific-plotting`. Plots complement the
  numeric verification table; they do not replace it.

## Hard rules

- Every formally reported metric must come from an actually executed cyeva comparison
  object. NumPy/manual formulas are allowed only as a post-cyeva validation check.
- Installing or importing cyeva alone is not enough; the selected comparison class and its
  metric methods must actually run.
- The final answer must name the cyeva version and comparison class used. If no cyeva metric
  method succeeded, state that verification is incomplete and do not present fallback
  scores as the result.
- Do not compare unmatched timestamps, stations, grids, levels, or accumulation periods.
- Do not mix units or infer precipitation duration from the value magnitude.
- Preserve signed MBE: positive means the forecast is higher than the observation.
- For wind direction, use circular differences and define handling of calm winds.
- Report threshold definitions beside categorical precipitation scores.
- Keep sample count beside every subgroup score; tiny groups must be flagged.
